# Polygon Gaming Ecological Research: Breakthroughs, not moments


In 1962, the world's first widely circulated and highly influential video game - "SpaceWar" was born, its poor game screen and monotonous playability at present, it seems difficult to call it. It can be regarded as a high-quality game, but its inspiration for game thinking has had a profound impact. After that, the emergence of arcade games, computer games and console games completely opened the era of games.

<b>「*Game design isn’t just a technological craft. It’s a twenty-first-century way of thinking and leading. And gameplay isn’t just a pastime. It’s a twenty-firstcentury way of working together to accomplish real change.*」</b>
<p align="right">--Jane McGonigal, "Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World"</p>

And with the development of blockchain technology, people under the influence of game design thinking have started to explore new game forms and development models in the combination of blockchain and games. data from DappRadar shows that the total number of blockchain games deployed on various public chains has reached 1258.

The current blockchain game model has made great progress compared to the early collection and gambling game models and game graphics and game quality have made a qualitative leap. However, it is still undeniable that there is still a long way to go for blockchain games compared with traditional video games. However, we always believe that behind every great change is the accumulation of countless small breakthroughs. The spiral progress of these seemingly immature game projects will eventually shape a more mature blockchain game ecology.

## 1. Overview of the background of blockchain game development
According to the viewpoint of Zhao Meijun, the founder of Abitchain, there are three ways to combine blockchain with games: the first is game coins blockchainlize, the second is game props and roles blockchainlize, and the third is game rules blockchainlize. Looking at the development of blockchain games with this viewpoint, we can see that from the beginning of the gambling game model to the subsequent game model of issuing and buying game props in the form of NFT, and then to the current game rules blockchainlize, the development model of game is also becoming more and more mature.

From the development example, the CryptoKitties born in 2 017 established the model of early blockchain game, but its too speculative attributes doomed it to be unable to develop for a long time. The gambling game that emerged on EOS and other chains in 2018 attracted a large number of players only through the "wealth effect", but behind it was the inevitable zero-sum game, and after the enthusiasm of the market faded, the winners would not enter again, and the losers would look at the blockchain game market with an irrational perspective after losing. This development model not only does not shape a good ecology of blockchain game development, but also destroys the image of blockchain games in the eyes of players, and the preconceived deception attribute after its link with gambling leads to the future development of blockchain games full of heavy obstacles.

After the 2019 long years of blockchain winter, 2020 DeFi boom led to new developments in the entire industry. Axie Infinity, The Sandbox and SkyWeaver, which are well known to us, all made their power during this period until they grew into today's blockchain game leaders. And after 2021 years of the Chinese crypto-market regulation in May, the whole industry entered a short recession period. However, it is worth noting that the decrease in Gas fees caused by the industry recession has created an excellent on-chain environment for the development of blockchain games. According to DappRadar, on April 18, 2021, the number of transactions in the blockchain game segment had reached $48.7 billion. The number of users on the blockchain game field is also increasing, with more than 780,000 as of July 31, an increase of more than 170 times compared to the beginning of the year.

After this development, the blockchain game officially ushered in the GameFi era, and the P2E model has become the mainstream direction of the current blockchain game development model. Here we will not discuss the sustainability of this model and the continuity of playability of these games, only from its data, the price of AXS has increased more than 200 times in the lowest point of 2021 compared with the highest point. The price of SAND has increased more than 100 times in the lowest point of 2021 compared with the highest point. The 30 daily revenue of Axie Infinity once exceeded the traditional hand game leader King of Glory at the highest point. The number of blockchain game users of the whole network even grew more than three times. Behind the growth of these figures, it reflects the market's confidence in the future of blockchain games, and also shows that the thinking and art of games will never disappear on the blockchain.

## 2. Overview of Polygon blockchain games eco-development
The growth of users brought by the development of blockchain games has continuously injected new vitality into the development of future games, however, influenced by the underlying logic of blockchain, the influx of a large number of users will inevitably mean higher Gas fees. For traditional gamers, excessive Gas will obviously become one of the main hindrances that prevent them from entering the blockchain games. On the other hand, an overly congested network greatly reduces the sense of gaming experience, thus affecting the growth of the number of users. And Polygon, as Ethereum Layer2, with its compatibility with EVM, lower Gas fee and faster processing speed, naturally becomes the object of attention for blockchain game developers, both for development and players' use, can get a better experience than the main network. In just one year, TVL on Polygon has grown by more than 5 orders of magnitude and the number of active addresses on the chain has more than 10 doubled.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 4: Changes in Active Addresses on the Polygon (source: glassnode)</b></p>

The booming Polygon ecosystem provides a comfortable environment for the development of blockchain games. According to Polygon's official data, the number of applications with the Gaming label deployed on Polygon has reached 274, while the total number of Dapps deployed on Polygon a year ago There are only about 120. These growing blockchain game projects have injected new blood into the Polygon game ecosystem, making it more prosperous in innovation and change.

The number of active users is one of the more important parameters to measure the popularity of blockchain games. Therefore, we selected the top 10 blockchain games deployed on Polygon with more than 1,000 active users in the past seven days in DappRadar as the focus of this report. Based on this, explore the current hotspots and development trends of Polygon blockchain games, and provide corresponding suggestions for the development of the Polygon blockchain game ecology.

### 2.1 Sunflower Farmers
Game Mode: Simulation Game&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Token: SFF

Sunflower Farmers was the first farming blockchain game on Polygon in 2022 years that got a lot of attention. The influx of players once caused the Gas consumption of the Sunflower Farmers contract to occupy more than 40% of Polygon's network. In this game, players need to donate $0.1 Matic to a charity to deploy a smart contract and open their own farm. The amount of reward decreases as the supply of tokens increases, so the earlier you enter the game, the more SFF tokens you can get. After that, users can use SFF to buy various tools to produce various raw materials, and through the synthesis of raw materials to generate their own NFT decorations, which can be bought or sold on OpenSea or QuickSwap.

### 2.2 Crazy Defense Heroes
Game Mode: Card Tower Defense Games&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Token: TOWER

As a blockchain game with independent APP, the game contains a total of three different types of cards, namely tower cards, magic cards and hero cards, and the cards are divided into four different levels: common, rare, epic and legendary, which have different attack and defense properties. The game can be downloaded from Google Play and apple store.

### 2.3 Arc8 by GAMEE
Game Mode: Mini Game Aggregator&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Token: GAMEE

Players can play 9 casual mini-games on Arc8's platform APP, where players can participate in one-on-one matches and team tournaments to win GAMEE tokens as prizes. There are currently two official APPs. Arc8 is used for casual games, and players can get GAMEE token rewards through battles here. And another Prizes is similar to the lottery software, players can get cash or GMAEE rewards through it. GAMEE can be used for the entry fee of some game projects on the platform, buying NFTs of G-Bots, upgrading Game Land in Arc8, and staking and participating in governance.

### 2.4 Pegaxy
Game Mode: Horse Racing&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tokens: PGX, VIS

Before the game starts, each player needs to acquire his own horse (PEGA) by buying, renting or breeding it to participate in the regular, tournament, monthly prep or big sprint finals. The token rewards vary from level to level, and the higher the level, the more tokens are awarded. At the same time, the breeding, evolution, food and equipment systems set in the game greatly enhance the playability of the game, after which the official will realize the transformation from automatic competition to manual control of their PEGA in the game, which further enhances the difficulty and randomness of the game. The token model is similar to Axie's dual token model, with PGX mainly used for market transactions, pledges and rewards for high-level races, while VIS is mainly used for horse breeding and rewards for various races.

### 2.5 REVV Racing
Game Mode: Racing&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tokens: REVV, CATA, SHRD

Similar to the Pegaxy we mentioned above, REVV Racing is a racing blockchain game, the difference is that REVV uses manual competition to carry out game events from the very beginning. Before starting the game, players need to buy their own NFT racing car on OpenSea, which can be purchased as a whole car or assembled after purchasing parts. The platform token REVV can be used in a range of platform games, including F1 Delta Time, MotoGP, Formula E and REVV Racing. REVV can be used for players to enter the game, buy car or component NFT, and event rewards and pledges. CATA and SHRD are mainly used for the newly added fusion system. Players can obtain SHRD rewards in the game, and then generate CATA by burning SHRD, and consume CATA to merge new design drawings.

### 2.6 My Crypto Heroes
Game mode: RPG&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Token: GUM

My Crypto Heroes is a blockchain game ported from the Ethereum mainnet to Polygon. On the surface, it is an RPG game, but it also has certain elements of casual character management. Before the game starts, the official will give players three heroes, and each team consists of three heroes. In the follow-up exploration, players can also collect and train historical heroes (Napoleon, Marx, Marie Curie, Yang Guifei, etc.) in the game universe through official purchases and market purchases, and the skills of each hero also correspond to them historical figures experienced a similar experience. The current game has two modes: PVE dungeon exploration and PVP player battle. The game process is fully automatic combat. Players can choose to skip by themselves. After completing the task, they can get corresponding experience and equipment rewards. All kinds of assets obtained in the game can be Transactions in the form of NFTs. Editing your own heroes is a major feature of the game. Players can spend GUM to DIY their own heroes to create their own unique Crypto Heroes.

### 2.7 Trade Race Manager
Game mode: racing&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Token: IOI

Similar to REVV Racing, Trade Race Manager (TRM) is also a racing blockchain game. And with the recent fall of TRM1, TRM2 will open its first round of testing in the near future. previous players' assets in TRM1 will be automatically transferred to TRM2. TRM2 only supports PC side to carry out, and from the official promos released, the picture quality of TRM2 has gradually approached the traditional PC game, which will be officially launched in mid-January.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 12: Trade Race Manager official website announcement</b></p>

### 2.8 Aavegotchi
Game mode: NFT collectiong&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Token: GHST

Aavegotchi ported their code from the Ethereum mainnet to Polygon in March 2021, with GHST as their native token. Its essence is a crypto collection game. Behind each generated pixel ghost Aavegotchis, there is a certain amount of Aave’s revenue generation token aToken pledged, and aToken generates revenue through Aave’s Lending Pool, so each Aavegotchis can be regarded as a digital depository. The value of the money pot itself will increase with the increase in interest. In addition, players can also participate in "rarity mining" by increasing the rarity of Aavegotchis. The higher the rarity, the more GHST token rewards they can get. The rarity can be changed by collateral (generated by aToken pledge), characteristics (initial generation, will affect the rarity of Aavegotchis, its performance in mini-games, and wearables that can be equipped, some of which can be changed through later interactions), and wearables.
Therefore, in conclusion, the intrinsic value of Aavegotchis lies in the value of the Aavegotchi collateral. If the collateral behind an Aavegotchis is 10 aDAI, its intrinsic value is 10 aDAI and the subsequent interest. In addition, there should also be a rarity value, through which rarity is used to conduct transactions in the secondary market and rarity mining.

### 2.9 CryptoBlades
Game mode: RPG&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Token: SKILL

CryptoBlades is an RPG blockchain game deployed on multiple chains. The game revolves around acquiring legendary blades and powerful heroes. At the beginning of the game, players need to create their characters, use the characters to participate in the subsequent battles, and get SKILL tokens in the battle. SKILL can be used for the casting and recasting of weapons. However, its fighting method still cannot get rid of the restrictions of the blockchain game turn-based system. It is more like a card game than an RPG game. The turn-based combat method greatly reduces the playability and viewing experience of the game, and it is difficult to attract players' long-term attention. At the same time, players can also trade characters or weapons through SKILL in the game market to use and obtain SKILL. In subsequent updates, the official may introduce a dual-token model, an in-game token that can only be used for weapon minting and recasting, to adjust game characteristics.

### 2.10 Idle Mystic
Game mode: RPG&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Token: IMT/SMT

From the perspective of the game's essential mode, Idle Mystic is more like an RPG-like Axie, except that the Pokemon in the game are replaced by various heroes. Before the game starts, players need to have at least 3 heroes before they can start fighting. The heroes from Mint have different skills and attributes. Two heroes can inherit the next generation of heroes (similar to Axie's breeding system). The abilities and attributes of the new hero are determined by the seven attributes and abilities of the previous generation of heroes. The current game supports PVE and PVP. Both IMT (governance tokens) and SMT (in-game tokens) can be obtained through the game. IMT is mainly used for community governance and participation in project dividends, while SMT is mainly used for player rewards.

# 3. Analysis of Blockchain Game Ecological Development of Polygon

Through a brief analysis of 10 popular blockchain games on the Polygon, we will discuss the future of the ecological development of the Polygon blockchain game from the characteristics and the two common problems faced by the blockchain game.

<b>Affected by the overall development of Polygon, the development of blockchain game ecology is slightly lagging behind.</b> Judging from the previous top 10 active users of blockchain games, there is only one game, Sunflower Farmers, that is truly native to Polygon and is in the top ten. The increase in the game's attention comes from the satisfaction brought to people by the unique early stage of SLG games on the one hand, and the irrational market heat brought about by its rich game returns and the other hand. However, with the gradual reduction of game rewards and the entry of more and more scripted players, it remains to be seen whether the popularity of the game can continue to be maintained. Compared with the top projects of ETH and BSC, although there is a certain gap in the popularity of other games, the number of active users is very close to them. Excluding the gap between the number of ETH users and Polygon, the two may be very close in terms of game quality.

<b>The distribution of project users is uneven, and the overall quality of blockchain games needs to be improved.</b> From the DappRadar data, the number of active users of the top 20 games can basically be maintained above 100, but the number of active users of the subsequent games is even less than a single digit, and most of the users are concentrated on the head blockchain game. The reason for this phenomenon is that it is easier for the head blockchain game to get external funding support, so as to better improve the project itself and attract more users to participate. The projects at the bottom of the ranking are affected by the quality of the project itself, so it is difficult to attract enough users, and thus difficult to attract external funding support. Thus forming a vicious circle of increasing gap. Therefore, for the lower-ranked blcokchain game projects, we can guide them to do more innovation in project ideas and give ecological funding support, so as to better attract external funding and incubate into better quality projects.

<b>The sports and RPG category of blockchain games still has a greater prospect of development.</b> Among the top ten blockchain games, six are sports and RPG (three sports and three RPG), which indicates that players tend to favor these two categories in game selection. From the perspective of players, sports games have the backing of traditional sports and are more likely to gain players' understanding and recognition. And RPG games, as one of the main branches of traditional video games, can also attract players to join them quickly. The players are also more likely to get started with these two types of games, understand the inner mechanics of the game, and reduce the cost of the game. But the disadvantage is that the gameplay of these six current blockchain games still needs to be improved. The racing blockchain game should further improve the game picture quality and operation experience, and the horse racing blockchain game can try to implement the active operation mode next, while the RPG blockchain game should consider jumping out of the limitation of the turn-based game and seek more flexible game mode.

<b>The convergence of GameFi model.</b> Although the current mainstream model of blockchain games is still the GameFi model, however, with the decreasing revenue of the game, whether the gameplay can retain the players is more worthy of attention. In terms of gameplay, if the blockchain game wants to stand out in the traditional game market, it must consider what is the most fundamental improvement that blockchain can bring to the game. Otherwise, the game is only put on the chain to use the blockchain, and GameFi is only used to attract players, it will still be difficult to retain players in the end. But thankfully, in the current top 10 games, Aavegotchi we see the element of the SLG game, Sunflower Farmers we see the element of the RPG of Stardew Valley. Behind the thinking about these points that really attract players that just should be how the blockchain and games can be better combined.

## 4. The thinking behind the development of blockchain games

The analysis of the on-chain game ecology can make us realize the current development status of the game ecology, however, from a more macro perspective, these two fundamental issues also deserve our attention.

<b>Web or APP?</b> In our analysis of Polygon's blockchain game ecosystem, we found that only a few blockchain games have chosen to develop standalone APPs or game clients, and most blockchain games still choose to use Web pages as the main carrier of games. For the Web 3.0era, Web APP (i.e. APP deployed on the browser and not affected by device changes) is undoubtedly the mainstream direction of future development, whose advantages include but are not limited to easier switching between different Dapps, compatibility of devices with more Dapps and lower development costs. However, for the blockchain game, Web APP is difficult to achieve some more complex screen processing, and can only achieve a more simple game form. Therefore, to improve the quality of the game, it is inevitable to make a trade-off with the development direction of Web3.0 and take the blockchain game's own path. Whether this can be solved with the progress of technology is still worth our consideration.

<b>Partial or full on-chain?</b> From the development history of the blockchain game we talked about in the previous chapter, it seems that all on-chain has become a trend, however, this trend comes more from the verification and exploration of various technologies of the blockchain game. Most of the traditional game players feel that each step of the chain operation generates Gas and the slow response time greatly reduces their game experience. Therefore, after the verification of the technology and returning to the game itself, we should consider more carefully what is the more suitable form of the combination of game and blockchain, so as to realize the higher level development of the blockchain game in the real sense.

The blockchain game was born in the game and developed in the blockchain. Standing at the forefront of technology, we must further reflect on the most essential attribute of the blockchain game - the game. Chasing after the heat and impatiently participating in various projects in the market will only turn the original groundbreaking <b>[game + blockchain]</b> revolution into a bubble of capital. Only by discovering the real needs of players and combining the pain points of the game with the blockchain can the blockchain game ecology go further.
